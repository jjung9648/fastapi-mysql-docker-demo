# FastAPI MySQL CRUD with Docker

This project is a CRUD application setup using FastAPI, MySQL, and Docker. It follows the general structure and concepts from the tutorial by [Medevel](https://medevel.com/fastapi-and-mysql-crud-docker/), but has been implemented with modifications and unique adjustments to fit personal learning and functionality goals.

## Project Overview

This CRUD application demonstrates how to set up a web API for basic data operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with:
- **FastAPI**: For handling API requests and responses
- **MySQL**: For database management and data storage
- **Docker**: For containerizing and managing dependencies

The code and structure have been adapted to align with the ideas from the Medevel guide but rewritten and modified where necessary to ensure a deeper understanding and personalized functionality.
